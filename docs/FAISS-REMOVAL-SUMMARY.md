# FAISS Removal Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete removal of FAISS dependencies from the Biology AI Tutor application, as part of the migration to Pinecone vector storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Updates

- Removed all FAISS-specific configuration variables from `src/config/index.js`
- Retained necessary directory paths for PDF documents and exam papers
- Removed FAISS references from `.env` and `.env.sample` files

### 2. File Deletions

- Removed `src/vector/faissRetriever.js` - Original FAISS vector retrieval implementation
- Removed `src/vector/examPapersRetriever.js` - Original FAISS exam papers retrieval implementation

### 3. Dependency Cleanup

- Removed `faiss-node` dependency from `package.json`

### 4. Directory Structure Changes

The following directories are no longer needed and can be safely removed from the deployment:

- `/api/faiss_index/`
- `/api/exam_papers_index/`

## Pinecone Implementation

The application now uses Pinecone exclusively for vector storage and retrieval:

- `src/vector/pineconeRetriever.js` - Handles biology content retrieval
- `src/vector/pineconeExamPapersRetriever.js` - Handles exam papers retrieval

Both retrievers maintain the same interface as the original FAISS retrievers, ensuring seamless integration with existing code.

## Benefits of Pinecone Migration

1. **Scalability**: Pinecone offers better scalability compared to local FAISS indexes
2. **Cloud-Based**: No need to manage local index files or worry about storage limitations
3. **Performance**: Improved query performance for large datasets
4. **Maintenance**: Reduced maintenance overhead as index management is handled by Pinecone

## Next Steps

1. Update deployment scripts to remove references to FAISS directories
2. Consider removing the FAISS index directories completely from the repository
3. Update project documentation to reflect Pinecone as the sole vector storage solution
