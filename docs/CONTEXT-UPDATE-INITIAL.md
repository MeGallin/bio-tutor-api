# Conversation Context Enhancement (Initial Implementation)

This update implements contextual memory for the Biology AI Tutor, enabling it to understand references like "this" and "it" across multiple messages in a conversation. The AI tutor now maintains an understanding of topics previously discussed and can resolve ambiguous references to provide more coherent responses.

## Key Features Added

1. **Context Memory**: The system now tracks key biology topics, entities, and the most recent primary topic discussed throughout a conversation.

2. **Reference Resolution**: When users ask questions with vague references like "Tell me more about this process" or "What is its purpose?", the AI understands what "this" and "its" refer to based on previous messages.

3. **Enhanced Prompts**: Updated teaching and information collection prompts to instruct the LLM to properly resolve references using conversation history.

4. **Context Analysis**: New utilities for extracting and tracking important biology topics and entities from user messages.

5. **LangSmith Integration**: Full tracing of conversation context through LangSmith, allowing you to monitor how the system maintains context over time.

## Technical Implementation

- Added `conversationContext` to the state model with `recentTopics`, `keyEntities`, and `lastTopic`
- Created a new utility module `contextAnalysis.js` for context extraction and management
- Enhanced router node to detect messages with contextual references
- Updated prompts to include historical context when generating responses
- Modified the SQLite persistence to store conversation context between sessions
- Extended LangSmith tracing to include context information

## Example Usage

1. User asks: "What is DNA?"
2. AI responds with DNA information
3. User follows up with: "How does it replicate?"
4. The AI now understands that "it" refers to DNA and provides information about DNA replication

## Future Improvements

- More sophisticated reference resolution with coreference analysis
- Topic clustering to better organize related conversation segments
- Context summarization for very long conversations
- User feedback loop to improve context understanding

The AI tutor will continue to learn from each conversation and provide increasingly coherent and contextually aware responses over time.
