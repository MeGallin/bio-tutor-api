# File Structure Cleanup - May 27, 2025

## Issue Identified

The API directory had inconsistent file structure with duplicate directories that broke the established `src/` pattern:

### Problems Found:

1. **Duplicate Controllers**:

   - `api/controllers/` (legacy, unused)
   - `api/src/controllers/` (active, used by routes)

2. **Duplicate Utils**:

   - `api/utils/` (legacy, contained only unused `analyzeQueryIntent.js`)
   - `api/src/utils/` (active, multiple utility files)

3. **Legacy Router**:
   - `api/router/` (legacy, contained `enhanced-router.js` not imported anywhere)
   - `api/src/graph/nodes/` (active router implementation)

## Resolution

All legacy directories were safely removed after verification:

### Verification Steps:

1. âœ… Confirmed no imports referencing the old directories
2. âœ… Created backup of removed directories in `api/backup_cleanup/`
3. âœ… Tested server startup after cleanup
4. âœ… Verified all functionality intact

### Removed Directories:

- `api/controllers/` â†’ Moved to backup
- `api/utils/` â†’ Moved to backup
- `api/router/` â†’ Moved to backup

## Current Clean Structure

```
api/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # âœ… All source code consolidated here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js          # Main entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/            # Configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/       # Request handlers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/            # Route definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/        # Express middleware
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ graph/             # LangGraph implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/             # Utility functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ savers/            # State persistence
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vector/            # FAISS retrievers
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ debug/                 # Debug utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                  # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ pdfs/                  # Knowledge base PDFs
â”œâ”€â”€ exam_papers/           # Exam paper sources
â”œâ”€â”€ faiss_index/           # FAISS vector database
â”œâ”€â”€ exam_papers_index/     # Exam papers vector database
â”œâ”€â”€ backup_cleanup/        # ðŸ”’ Backup of removed directories
â””â”€â”€ package.json           # "main": "src/server.js"
```

## Benefits

- âœ… Consistent `src/` pattern maintained
- âœ… No more confusion about which files are active
- âœ… Cleaner project structure for new developers
- âœ… All legacy code safely preserved in backup
- âœ… Application functionality preserved

## Restoration (if needed)

If any of the removed code is needed:

```bash
# Restore from backup
cp -r backup_cleanup/[directory]/ ./
```

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Structure successfully cleaned up without breaking functionality.
